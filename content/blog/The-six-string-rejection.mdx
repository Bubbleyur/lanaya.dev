# The Six-String Rejection

I didn’t pick up a guitar because I had a burning passion for music. I picked it up because of a girl.

I saw her playing, and she looked incredible doing it. In my head, the plan was simple: if I could play the guitar, I could get closer to her. I thought the music would be the bridge between us. But reality hit hard—the guitar didn't bring us together. The romantic "spark" never happened.

But while the girl stayed out of reach, the instrument stayed in my hands. I realized that even if she wasn't there, the feeling of being amazed by the guitar remained.

That was the first real ignition.

## The Strum and the Shadow

My first step was the basics: learning chords and how to strum. Like anyone starting out, I wanted to show off. I brought my skills to my friends, hoping for a moment of validation.

But instead of feeling like a star, I met the "shadow." One of my friends was already at a level I couldn't comprehend. He was competent, fast, and effortless. Seeing him play made me feel an instant wave of insecurity. I felt small.

Instead of stopping, that insecurity became my second trigger. I didn't want to just strum anymore. I wanted to understand the complexity he was playing. I stopped looking for applause and started looking at **Tablature**.

## The Tablature Trap

Right now, I am deep in the world of **Fingerstyle**. It’s a completely different beast than just hitting chords. 

I’ve moved from simple strumming to studying tabs, but I’ve noticed a new gap. I am currently "buying" or "learning" the tabs created by others, but I haven't yet become the creator of the tabs themselves. I can follow the map, but I’m not yet the one drawing it.

The transition from *Strumming* to *Tablature* felt abrupt. The logic of how fingers move independently across the strings is a puzzle that a book or a video can't fully solve for you. You have to feel the tension yourself.

## What Changed

The time I've spent in the world of music has done more than just callused my fingertips. It changed my mindset about what "skill" actually is.

Before, I thought playing music was about looking cool or getting the girl. Now, I realize how hard it actually is to master this system. The shift wasn't about being "good"; it was about "hearing."

Today, I don't just hear a song. I hear the chord structures. I can identify the progression and think about how to translate it into a different genre or a better voicing. I see the layers behind the melody.

## Firestarter

A guitar is not a tool for attraction. It is a tool for transformation.

It didn't get me the girl, but it gave me a language. It didn’t make me better than my friend, but it made me better than the version of myself that was afraid to try.

Maybe you don't need a deep, poetic reason to start. Maybe you just need a crush, a bit of insecurity, and a guitar that challenges you to be better.

The fire didn’t start because I succeeded in my original goal.  
It started because I failed—and decided to keep playing anyway.

And once the music starts, you never hear the silence the same way again.

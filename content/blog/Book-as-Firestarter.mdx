# Book as Firestarter

I didn’t enter the library because I loved books. I entered because of a board game.

Back in high school, my friends and I used to hang out in the library just to play. It wasn’t about studying or becoming intellectual. It was simply a place to gather. But over time, I started noticing something different. Some of my friends — including one girl who caught my attention — were actually reading. Not for exams. Not because teachers told them to. They chose to.

And strangely, they felt different. Calmer. More composed. There was a certain depth in the way they carried themselves. That difference made me curious. I didn’t want to read because I loved books. I wanted to understand why people who read seemed to think differently.

That curiosity was the first spark.

## The First Purchase

My first real step was simple. I went to a bookstore and bought a self-improvement book. I didn’t fully understand what I was looking for yet. I just wanted to see what was inside the world that seemed to shape people quietly.

Later, when I entered the world of informatics, I bought another book: *Python to Firebase*. That book became something else entirely. It wasn’t just reading. It became exploration.

I studied one chapter every two days. At first, it felt structured. Then it started to feel disconnected. One chapter discussed SQL, and a few chapters later it jumped into Firebase. The transition felt abrupt. Something didn’t click.

Instead of stopping, I went deeper. I searched online to fill the gaps. I tried to understand how everything connected — the backend flow, folder structures, the logic behind systems. The book stopped being a complete guide. It became a trigger.

And that’s when I realized something important: a book doesn’t need to be perfect to be powerful. It only needs to ignite curiosity.

## Only Three Books

Until today, I have only truly finished three books — two self-improvement books and one technical book. That’s not a long list. But quantity was never the point.

One of those books lit a fire.

It pushed me to explore beyond the page. From SQL to Firebase. From Flask to FastAPI. From Jinja to React. The book ended, but the learning didn’t. It expanded into architecture flow, system thinking, and the way applications are structured behind the scenes.

The real value wasn’t in finishing the book. It was in the questions that followed after closing it.

## What Changed

Reading didn’t instantly transform me. It didn’t magically make me smarter. The change was slower and quieter.

It changed how I think. It changed how I see the world. It shifted my ambition.

Before reading seriously, learning felt like completing tasks. After reading, learning felt like building layers. Before, I followed tutorials step by step. After, I started questioning structure and flow. I became less obsessed with finishing and more interested in understanding.

The shift wasn’t loud. But it was permanent.

## Firestarter

A book is not knowledge itself. It is ignition.

It doesn’t build the engine for you. It doesn’t run the system. But it lights something inside you — and once curiosity is alive, learning stops feeling forced. It becomes self-driven.

You don’t suddenly become a “reader.” You become someone who seeks.

Maybe you don’t need to read ten books this year. Maybe you need one — one book that makes you uncomfortable, one that makes you open more tabs at night, one that makes you rethink how you approach learning.

For me, it started with a board game in a library. It continued with a random self-improvement purchase. And it truly ignited with a technical book that wasn’t even perfectly structured.

Sometimes, the fire doesn’t start because the book is great.  
It starts because you are ready to question.

And once the fire starts, you never learn the same way again.
